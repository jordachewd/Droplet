## MEDIUM — Phase 144 — Admin Config In-Memory Cache

> 5+ DB round trips per `/api/openai` request for admin settings that change infrequently.

**What to do:**

1. Create `src/lib/utils/config-cache.ts` — simple in-memory cache with 30s TTL.
2. Wrap each `getEffective*` resolver's DB calls in the cache.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Admin config queries cached with 30s TTL
- [ ] Build passes, tests pass

---

## MEDIUM — Phase 145 — Upload Filename Collision Prevention

**File:** `src/app/api/upload/route.tsx`

**What to do:** Replace `Date.now()` with `crypto.randomUUID()` in upload filename generation.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Upload filenames use `crypto.randomUUID()`
- [ ] Build passes

---

## MEDIUM — Phase 165 — Checkout Success Page DB Polling

> After Stripe redirects to checkout success, webhook may not have processed yet. User sees "success" but plan is still Lite.

**What to do:**

1. Add a client component that polls a plan-status endpoint every 3-5s for up to 30s.
2. Show "Confirming your plan upgrade..." initially.
3. On confirmation: "Plan upgraded successfully!" with green indicator.
4. On timeout: "Payment successful. Your plan will be updated shortly."

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Checkout success page shows plan confirmation status
- [ ] Polling stops after confirmation or 30s timeout
- [ ] Build passes

---

## LOW — Phase 146 — Admin User Detail Transaction Limit

**What to do:** Add `.limit(50)` to the transaction query in `getAdminUserDetail`.

---

## LOW — Phase 147 — Rename `.tsx` Utility Files to `.ts`

**Files:** `handleError.tsx`, `getPlanStatus.tsx`, `getFullName.tsx`, `getFormattedDate.tsx`, `generateString.tsx`

---

## LOW — Phase 148 — Bulk Operations Partial-Failure Reporting

**What to do:** Track successful/failed operations in bulk admin actions, return partial results.

---

## ON HOLD — Deferred

### Phase 29.x — Zod/Zustand app-wide modernization

### Phase 26.x — Persona-aware media prompts, Stripe auto-renewal

### Legal/nav/footer admin configurability — Deferred to v2
